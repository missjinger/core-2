# todo
 - patch 20 having issue on the template load. set to patch 10 for now, eg below
 - Item (Entry: 15304) has unknown (wrong or not listed in `item_enchantment_template`) RandomProperty (477)
 - Item RandomProperty id #813 used in `item_template` but it doesn't have records in `item_enchantment_template` table.
 - Table 'creature_loot_template' entry 9819 (creature entry) not exist but used as loot id in DB.
 - [ ] find the reason, need to change the patch_max from 10 to 20 later
 - [ ]add expansion into WorldSocket.cpp HandleAuthSession
 

# notes
 - struct MapEntry inside Map.h this is actually read from SQL map_template but other core are reading in the Map.dbc
 - DBCfmt.h has the DBC structure in string format, inside DBCStructure.h the entry has to be same sequence as the fmt
 - SQLStorages.cpp has the database strictire in string format, the entry also has to be same sequence as teh fmt
 
 - realmlist.cpp has 8608 client support with hash data, has to disable the strictversioncheck in realmd.conf
 
# Knowledge
 - Knowledge 0b1db35f replace authcrypt with BigNumber, this fixed the wrong package size issue, now able to login to the char create screen, looks like the classic and tbc are using different crypt method?
